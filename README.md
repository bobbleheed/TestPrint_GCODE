# TestPrint_GCODE
GCODE files for tuning 3D printers.

The use of another individuals GCODE is done at your own risk!

To use my PA_tuning_5k.gcode file, the [M900.cfg](https://github.com/bobbleheed/Klipper_Configurations/tree/main/Voron%20V2%2C%20300) must be included within your printer config file. This GCODE uses Marlin's Linear Advance test pattern to tune Klipper's Pressure Advance. You can create your own GCODE at: https://marlinfw.org/tools/lin_advance/k-factor.html
